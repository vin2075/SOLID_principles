-- Identifying Responsibilities
The OrderProcessor class currently violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) because it handles multiple concerns:

Order Calculation – Computes the total price, applying discounts and taxes.
Order Persistence – Saves order details to the database.
Order Notification – Sends an order confirmation email to the customer.

--------
Why Multiple Responsibilities Are Problematic
Tightly Coupled Code: Changes in one functionality (e.g., tax rules) might unintentionally affect another (e.g., database persistence).
Difficult to Maintain & Extend: If we need to modify the email format, we shouldn't have to touch price calculations or database operations.
Reduced Testability: Testing individual functionalities is harder because they are intertwined.
Proposed Refactor

---------
We can split OrderProcessor into three separate classes:

OrderCalculator – Responsible for calculating the total price, applying discounts, and computing taxes.
OrderRepository – Handles database interactions, such as saving order details.
OrderNotifier – Manages email notifications.
A new class, OrderProcessor, will now act as a coordinator, ensuring each component performs its specific task.

-- Justification & Benefits
By refactoring, we ensure each class has a single responsibility, making the system more modular and maintainable:

Improved Readability: Each class does one thing well, making it easier to understand.
Better Testability: We can independently test order calculations, database interactions, and email notifications.
Easier Modifications: Changes in tax rules or notification mechanisms won’t impact order persistence logic.
